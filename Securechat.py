# Secure Chat Application (End-to-End Encrypted)

##  Project Overview
The **Secure Chat Application** is a Python-based messaging system that enables **secure, encrypted communication between two users**.  
The project demonstrates the implementation of **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** using cryptographic techniques and socket programming.

This project was developed as part of the **RISE Internship – Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking** program.

## Problem Statement
Most conventional chat applications do not offer **end-to-end encryption by default**, making user messages vulnerable to:
- Unauthorized access
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Data interception

---

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Develop a secure chat application
- Ensure messages are encrypted before transmission
- Allow decryption only at the receiver’s end
- Demonstrate secure communication practices

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Networking:** Socket Programming  
- **Cryptography:** RSA / PyCryptodome  
- **GUI (Optional):** Tkinter / PyQt  
- **Operating System:** Windows / Linux  

---

## System Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyCryptodome library
- Basic understanding of networking and cryptography

### Installation
```bash
pip install pycryptodome
